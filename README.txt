**Welcome to our Dominoes set up!**

Things I have learnt:

Do not try and use integration within IntelliJ. I'm sure it's possible to get it working, but I definitely have no
issue using GitHub.

The first time you create a new file you will get a popup that asks if you would like to add the file to the
repository. Select "No", clicking the "Don't ask again" box. We will add new things via commits solely created and
controlled via Github.

Once you have got this project initially set up, go back to Github and create your own branch for the first time before
any other changes are made.

Every time you switch back to Github it will show you your local changes. As a rule of thumb be very wary of files
listed here that you did not realise you had changed. This could end up being something particular to your setup
which may bother everyone else if merged to the group project. (I'm thinking about the sole PC user of the team here...)

This can be a handy note! If you're working late into the night and don't want to create a socially polite message, at
least jot down here what's been done whilst it's fresh.

Really hoping that you all get this setup without an issue! Hopefully I'll find lots of lovely "Hooray, success!"
messages when I next read this....
